# WeatherApp
Weather App created by Pritam in python

Modules used in python :- win32.com,requests,json

1. The dispatch method in the win32.com is used for making the app speak out the data retrieved through the API key, as this this method interacts with the windows TTS SDK to make windows read out the data.
2. The get method in request module is used for retrieving the data from the api
3. The json library is used for storing the data in the form of dictionaries and accessing only certain needed keys in the created dictionary
